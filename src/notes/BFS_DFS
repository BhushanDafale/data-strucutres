# BFS - Breadth First Traversal (Level Order Traversal)

# DFS - Depth First Traversal 
		Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
		Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
		Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
		
# Time Complexity 
  - All 4 traversal required O(n) time complexity as they visit every node at once.

# Extra Space
  - BFS: O(w), w - maximum width of binary tree
  	- queue one by one stores nodes of different level
  	
  - DFS: O(h), h - maximum height of binary tree
  	- stack (or function call stack) stores all ancestors of a node.
