Binary tree
----------
1. at most 2 children 
2. contains 
	- data
	- pointer to left child 
	- pointer to right child
3. hierarchical data structure	

=> Why tree?
- information that naturally form hierarchy.
- provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and Slower than array)
- provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and Slower than unordered Linked List)
- Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
